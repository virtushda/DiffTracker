# Diff Tracker

[中文说明](./README_CN.md)


Diff Tracker is a VS Code extension that records file changes and provides three review modes:
- Inline readonly diff document
- VS Code side-by-side diff
- Cursor-like WebView diff with floating Undo/Keep actions

**Fork From [wizyoung/DiffTracker](https://github.com/wizyoung/DiffTracker)**


## Screenshots

💥 **Highlights in 0.6.0: Auto-start recording, persistent review sessions, automation-only tracking, and more flexible WebView opening behavior.**

## Features
- [New 🚀] Pending, unaccepted changes survive VS Code restarts and are restored from the saved baseline
- [New 🚀] Automation-only tracking mode for AI/agent or extension-driven edits
- [New 🚀] Configurable WebView opening position (`current group` or `beside`)
- [New 🚀] Automatically start recording file changes after the extension is activated
- Activity Bar **Change Recording** tree with file grouping
- Recording mode (start/stop) with workspace baseline snapshot
- Workspace-wide file watching (including external file changes)
- Inline readonly diff view with line and word-level highlights
- Side-by-side diff (`Original ↔ Current`) via built-in VS Code diff
- Cursor-like WebView diff (Split/Unified, Wrap, Expand, Keep All, Reject All)
- Block-wise actions: Undo/Keep per change block
- File-level actions: Revert file, Revert all files, Keep all changes in file
- Deleted-line badge, CodeLens actions, and hover details
- Settings panel + Watch Ignore editor (`.gitignore` style patterns)

## Usage

1. Open **Diff Tracker** from the Activity Bar.
2. Recording starts automatically after the extension activates.
3. Edit files in your workspace.
4. In **Change Recording**, click a changed file to open inline diff.
5. Use context menu or editor title buttons to open:
   - Inline Diff (active file)
   - Side-by-Side Diff
   - WebView Diff
6. In WebView Diff, use block-level **Undo/Keep** or file-level **Keep All/Reject All**.
7. Use **Revert File** / **Revert All Changes** as needed.
8. Stop recording when done.

## How It Works

When recording starts, Diff Tracker:
1. Captures baseline snapshots for workspace files (batched)
2. Tracks file/document changes and rebuilds line/block diffs
3. Serves virtual inline/original documents
4. Restores pending changes after restart until they are accepted/reverted or the baseline is cleared
5. Keeps tree, decorations, CodeLens, and WebView in sync

## Installation

### From VSIX
1. Download the .vsix file
2. Open VS Code
3. Open Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X)
4. Click ... -> Install from VSIX...
5. Select the downloaded .vsix

### Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm run compile
4. Press F5 to launch the Extension Development Host

## Requirements

- VS Code ^1.80.0

## Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `diffTracker.showDeletedLinesBadge` | `true` | Show a badge indicating deleted lines |
| `diffTracker.showCodeLens` | `true` | Show CodeLens actions (Revert/Keep) above change blocks |
| `diffTracker.highlightAddedLines` | `true` | Highlight added lines with green background |
| `diffTracker.highlightModifiedLines` | `true` | Highlight modified lines with blue background |
| `diffTracker.highlightWordChanges` | `true` | Highlight word-level changes within modified lines |
| `diffTracker.openWebviewBeside` | `false` | Open Webview diff in a side editor group instead of the current editor group |
| `diffTracker.useGitIgnoreExcludes` | `true` | Apply ignore rules from `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` |
| `diffTracker.useBuiltInExcludes` | `true` | Apply built-in ignore rules for common folders like `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, and `coverage` |
| `diffTracker.useVSCodeExcludes` | `true` | Apply VS Code exclude settings from `files.watcherExclude`, `search.exclude`, and `files.exclude` |
| `diffTracker.watchExclude` | `[]` | Additional watch ignore patterns (`.gitignore` style) |
| `diffTracker.onlyTrackAutomatedChanges` | `false` | Ignore manual typing in VS Code. External CLI/tool edits are still tracked, and VS Code extension edits can be tracked when they open an automation session first |

You can toggle display/highlight/ignore settings in the sidebar **Settings** panel, and edit watch ignore patterns via **Edit Watch Ignores**.

When `diffTracker.openWebviewBeside` is enabled, Webview diff opens in a side editor group. By default it opens in the current editor group.

When `diffTracker.onlyTrackAutomatedChanges` is enabled:
- Manual typing in the editor is ignored
- External tools/CLI that modify files on disk are still tracked through file watchers
- VS Code extensions should call `diffTracker.beginAutomationSession` before applying edits, and `diffTracker.endAutomationSession` after they finish

Example integration from another VS Code extension:

```ts
const sessionId = await vscode.commands.executeCommand<string>(
  'diffTracker.beginAutomationSession',
  { allFiles: true, ttlMs: 30000 }
);

try {
  // apply WorkspaceEdit or editor edits here
} finally {
  await vscode.commands.executeCommand('diffTracker.endAutomationSession', sessionId);
}
```

## Known Issues

- Pure line-ending-style changes (CRLF/LF only) are currently treated as no logical content change.
- If you find a reproducible diff/render edge case, please open an issue with a minimal file sample.
