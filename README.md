## Features

- Activity Bar view for tracked changes
- Recording mode to start and stop tracking
- Inline diff with added/removed highlights
- **Word-level diff highlighting** - precisely highlights changed words within modified lines
- Side-by-side diff on demand
- Hover details for deleted/modified content
- Multi-file tracking with timestamps
- Block-wise Revert/Keep buttons (like Cursor)
- File-level "Revert All" / "Keep All" CodeLens
- Revert per file or revert all
- Clear all tracked diffs
- Editor title buttons for inline and side-by-side diff
- Settings panel in sidebar to toggle display options

## Usage

1. Open the Diff Tracker view from the Activity Bar.
2. Click Start Recording.
3. Edit any file in your workspace.
4. Click a file in the left list to open the inline diff.
5. Use the editor title buttons to open:
   - Inline Diff (single-column)
   - Side-by-Side Diff
6. Use Revert File or Revert All as needed.
7. Click Clear Diffs to remove all tracked changes.
8. Click Stop Recording when you are done.

## How It Works

When recording starts, Diff Tracker:
1. Captures a baseline snapshot for files
2. Watches for content changes
3. Builds inline and side-by-side diffs
4. Updates the editor and the changes view in real time
