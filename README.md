Diff Tracker is a VS Code extension that records file changes and provides three review modes:
- Inline readonly diff document
- VS Code side-by-side diff
- Cursor-like WebView diff with floating Undo/Keep actions

## Screenshots

💥 **New in 0.4.0. Cursor like floating accept/reject buttons!**

## Features

- Activity Bar **Change Recording** tree with file grouping
- Recording mode (start/stop) with workspace baseline snapshot
- Workspace-wide file watching (including external file changes)
- Inline readonly diff view with line and word-level highlights
- Side-by-side diff (`Original ↔ Current`) via built-in VS Code diff
- Cursor-like WebView diff (Split/Unified, Wrap, Expand, Keep All, Reject All)
- Block-wise actions: Undo/Keep per change block
- File-level actions: Revert file, Revert all files, Keep all changes in file
- Deleted-line badge, CodeLens actions, and hover details
- Settings panel + Watch Ignore editor (`.gitignore` style patterns)

## Usage

1. Open **Diff Tracker** from the Activity Bar.
2. Click **Start Recording**.
3. Edit files in your workspace.
4. In **Change Recording**, click a changed file to open inline diff.
5. Use context menu or editor title buttons to open:
   - Inline Diff (active file)
   - Side-by-Side Diff
   - WebView Diff
6. In WebView Diff, use block-level **Undo/Keep** or file-level **Keep All/Reject All**.
7. Use **Revert File** / **Revert All Changes** as needed.
8. Stop recording when done.

## How It Works

When recording starts, Diff Tracker:
1. Captures baseline snapshots for workspace files (batched)
2. Tracks file/document changes and rebuilds line/block diffs
3. Serves virtual inline/original documents
4. Keeps tree, decorations, CodeLens, and WebView in sync

## Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `diffTracker.showDeletedLinesBadge` | `true` | Show a badge indicating deleted lines |
| `diffTracker.showCodeLens` | `true` | Show CodeLens actions (Revert/Keep) above change blocks |
| `diffTracker.highlightAddedLines` | `true` | Highlight added lines with green background |
| `diffTracker.highlightModifiedLines` | `true` | Highlight modified lines with blue background |
| `diffTracker.highlightWordChanges` | `true` | Highlight word-level changes within modified lines |

You can toggle display/highlight settings in the sidebar **Settings** panel, and edit watch ignore patterns via **Edit Watch Ignores**.

## Known Issues

- Pure line-ending-style changes (CRLF/LF only) are currently treated as no logical content change.
- If you find a reproducible diff/render edge case, please open an issue with a minimal file sample.
